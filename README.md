## Quick Shpiel

<br>

When I first looked at using Lambda, the number one thing I really wanted to know was: could I render a Blade form without mounting an entire Laravel Framework web app. This would be so fan-tan-bu-lous-ly helpful that this ability alone would be worth learning Lambda (oh...it is true... be careful what you wish for).

I had never tried to render a Blade form on its own before, incredibly, but I was sure that it could be done. And, if it could be done, could it be done on Lambda? And, if it could be done on Lambda, could it be done without having to physically set up the production environment? 

<br>

(i) Could I render a Blade form by composer installling individual Illuminate packages? Yes. 

I did a video about using individual Illuminate packages, at [https://phpserverlessproject.com/video/app-less-laravel-keeping-it-classy](https://phpserverlessproject.com/video/app-less-laravel-keeping-it-classy).

<br>

(ii) Could I render a Blade form thusly on Lambda? Yes. 

Which led me to write this blog post: [https://phpserverlessproject.com/lambda-writable-folder-tmp](https://phpserverlessproject.com/lambda-writable-folder-tmp).

(iii) Could it be done on Lambda without having to physically set up prod? Yes.

## Props to Matt Stauffer's Kick-Ass "Torch" Repo!

<br>

A very special thank you to Matt Stauffer for putting together his ["Torch" repo](https://github.com/mattstauffer/Torch). It was well after midnight, I couldn't quite get the rendering to work, and I vaguely remembered reading about someone figuring out how to use pieces of the Laravel Framework, without launching the Framework in an app. So I searched. I found Matt's Torch repo, and successfully rendered a Blade form using his ["view component"](https://github.com/mattstauffer/Torch/tree/master/components/view).

It worked so well that [I created a repo](https://github.com/lasallesoftware-serverless/render-blade-lambda) to adapt Torch's view component, to streamline the code for specific use on Lambda.
